# 0x1A98

## Intro
This is a simple HC08 emulator. Go into the [docs](docs) folder to check the details.
For now, it just simulates the main.asm program given by the CAML course resources on eConestoga.

## Build
This project uses [xmake](https://xmake.io/#/getting_started) as a build system.

## Support
- macOS
- Windows
- Linux (not tested yet)

## TODO:
- [ ] Use TDD to implement all the rest instructions.
- [ ] A simple editor can used to check and modify the memory.
